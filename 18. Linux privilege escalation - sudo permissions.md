* **To see which commands the current user can run**
  * `sudo -l`
 
*  **What is "man" binary**
  * "man" binary on Linux gives an access to the manual files for utilites
  * If "man" binary is misconfigured, unprivileged accounts can run it and it's dangerous.
  * Just to understand, how "man" works, it can be used to lookup the manual of a command:
  * `man ls` --> This will provide a manual on how to use the "ls" command.
  * Now if the "man" binary is misconfigured, it can be run with sudo privileges:
  * `sudo man cat`
  * And we can execute: `!/bin/bash` inside the man file for any command.
