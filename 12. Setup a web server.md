* Python comes with a built-in module known as
  * SimpleHTTPServer (Python2) and http.server (Python3)
  * These can be used to facilitate a simple HTTP server that gives you standard GET and HEAD request handlers.
 
  * `python -m SimpleHTTPServer [port number could be any free port]`
  * `python3 -m http.server [port number]`
