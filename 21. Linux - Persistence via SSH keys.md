 * If SSH service is enabled on a system, it can be configured to to be accessible through a SSH key instead of username and password.
 * With the provided username and password:
 * `ssh [username]@[Target IP]`
 * `ls -al`
 * We can see there is a binary named "wait"
 * It is built in a way to simulate the scenario when password is changed and our access is blocked.
 * ".ssh" folder will contain id_rsa --> private key and id_rsa.pub--->public key
 * We will copy id_rsa to the attacker's machine.
 * `exit`
 * **Transfer files from a target system to our local system via SSH**
 * `scp [username]@[Target IP]:[path to the file on target, like, ~/ .ssh/id_rsa]`
 * Provide permissions: `chmod 400 id_rsa`
 * As the key is copied to our system, we can log in to the target via SSH and delete the wait binary.
 * `ssh [username]@[Target_IP]`
 * `rm wait` --> this will log us out.
 * `ssh -i id_rsa [ysername]@[target IP]`
 * This should let us into the target without providing the password.

 * IDEAL Workflow:
 * Generate a SSH key pair on attacker's machine
 * Keep the private key on the attacker.
 * Transfer the public key to the target under SSH folder.
