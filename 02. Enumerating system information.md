### What to enumerate
* Hostname (Can be obtained when we run "sysinfo" command in a meterpreter session)
* OS name (eg: Windows 7, 8)
* OS build and service pack (eg: Windows 7 SP1 7600)
* OS Architecture (x64/x86)
* Installed updates/ Hotfixes --> To know which vulnerabilities have been patched

* PRACTICAL
* If a vulnerable HFS version is present on the target
* `use exploit/windows/http/rejetto_hfs_exec`
* `systeminfo` command can be useful to know a lot of information about the target. This command can be run through shell obtained via meterpreter session
* We will also get hotfixes list through this command, which can be searched online with their codes
* Windows commands can be used to enumerate a list of installed updates in addition to the HotFix URL:
  * `wmic qfe get Caption,Description,HotFixID,InstalledOn`
* Some systems also have file named "eula.txt" containing more info about the OS:
  * Inside the meterpreter session: `cd C:\\`
  * `cd Windows\System32`
  * `cat eula.txt`
